 OK. I will see you at six.


 My daughter is going to college.
 That's great, but it must be expensive.

 A grant? What's a grant?
 The government is giving her money.
 To pay for her education?
 That's right.
 Does it pay for everything?
 No, she has a loan, too.

 You have to pay back a loan; a grant is a gift.


 Would you like to go to a pop concert?
 Well, I'd like to... but when is it?
 On Friday evening.
 What a pity! I'm busy on Friday.

 Great, I'll see you Friday!


 Ah-choo!
 God bless you!

 You'd better not drive then!

Cab  Hello.
 Hello.
Cab  Where do you want to go?
 70 Maple Street, please.
Cab  70 Mibble Street.
 No, Maple street.
Cab  Maple Street...let's see... Is that near St. David Street?

 Toronto.


 I hate to get up in the morning.
 Me too! What time do you get up?
 At six o'clock.

 You're lucky. What do you do?
 I own a bookstore.
 What time does your store open?
 At eight-thirty.


 This heat is killing me!
 Me too! It must be ninety-five degrees.
 I would like a cold drink.
 I'll get you one.
 Thanks. Mmm. This tastes good!
 It does, jeez, this hot weather makes me lazy.
 Me too, get me another drink?




 I guess if you're lazy no one else is allowed to be!
 He he he, thanks for understanding!


 Hey! Hey!
 What's wrong?
 There is something wrong with the phone. I'm getting a strange noise.
 Are you? I can hear you very clearly.
 Hello! Hello!
 This pay phone might be out of order. I'll call you again with another phone....
 Hello! How about now? Is there still a strange noise?
 Yes. Perhaps my phone is out of order.
 You should get in touch with the phone company.


 Hey! What's the matter with the phone?(Handing the receiver to B) Listen to this
peculiar noise.
 It doesn't sound like a dial tone.
 It must be out of order. We'd better notify the phone company.
 How do we do that? We can't use the phone.
 Let's go next door and use our neighbour's phone.
 He's always complaining about people. I don't want to ask any favours of him.
 How about across the street?
 I forgot about  Riley! I'm sure she'd let us use her phone.


 Does it take long to get a visa?
  It depends on the season. Anywhere from one month to two months.
 What do I need to do?
  Fill out an application form and wait.
 Will there be a long waiting period?
  Not if you don't run into any government delays.


  Well, this woman may be suitable for the job. But is she energetic enough?
  Yes, she certainly seems to have lots of energy.
  Mm. She's got to be ambitious too. Is she?
  Yes, she has plenty of ambition.
  And we really need a flexible sort of person. Do you think she is?
  Mm. She seems to be determined enough, but she's a little tough.




  Well I guess we will give her a try, and see how she works out!


 What are you so happy about? You're grinning from ear to ear.
 Sandy and I are going to go out this weekend.
 Oh, yeah? That's fast work. That's great! Which night are you going to see her--
Friday or Saturday?
 On Friday. She isn't going to be in town on Saturday and Sunday. She's going to
visit a friend in Quebec.
 What are you going to do on Friday?
 I don't know yet. Do you have any ideas?
 How about taking her out to a Chinese restaurant? I've heard that she likes
Chinese food.
 That's a great idea.
 What are you going to wear on your date?
 I am going to wear my new suit.
 That's too formal. Wear your jeans and a T-shirt.
 How about your sports jacket? Are you going to wear it Friday night?
 No, I am not. Go ahead and wear it.


 Hi, how are you? You look tired. Did you sleep okay last night?
 No, I didn't.
 Why? What did you do yesterday?
 I went to a nightclub last night and danced all night.
 Oh, yeah? Did you have a good time?
 I had a wonderful time, but I'm beat today.
 What time did you leave the nightclub?
 I left at about 00 a.m.
 I'm not surprised that you're tired. Which nightclub did you go to?
 Fantastic. It's on Ontario Street. It's really nice.


 Do I check in here for Air Canada to Mexico?
  Do you already have your ticket?
 Yes. Here you are.
  Thank you. Can you put your luggage up here, please?
 Sure, I have three suitcases.
  We allow only two pieces. You'll have to pay an extra charge.
 Oh! Can I carry this one with me?
  No, I'm sorry. It won't fit under your seat. That's $45.00.
 Here you are.




  Thank you. You can choose your seat. A window seat or aisle seat?
 I'd like a window seat, please.
  Fine. Seat 15A. Here's your ticket and your boarding pass. Enjoy your flight!


Customs  Good morning. Can I see your passport?
 Certainly. Here it is.
 Yes, that's all right. Have you got anything to declare?
 Yes, I have. I've got some whisky and some cigarettes.
 How much whisky have you got?
 A litre.
 That's all right. And how many cigarettes have you got?
 Two hundred.
 Fine. What about perfume?
 Er...No, I haven't.
 Good. Open your case, please.
 Pardon?
 Open your case, please. Open it now! Oh, dear! Look at this! You've got three
bottles of whisky, four hundred cigarettes and a lot of perfume!
 Does that mean I can't go?


  Well, hello,  Wallace. You seem unusually happy today.
  I just became a father!
  Congratulations. A boy or a girl?
  You never saw such a cute girl. Nine pounds, three ounces...and as cute as a
button.
  Doesn't this call for cigars?
  Oh, yes. I forgot about the cigars. Here, have one.
  Thank you. How is your wife?
  She's just fine.


 Where are you going?
 To Canada.
 Why are you going there?
 I'm going to learn English; there is a school there that has an excellent program.
 Is learning English going to be difficult?
 Yes. I have to study and practice a lot.
 Where is your school?
 It's in a town called St.Catharines. In Ontario.
 I'm jealous, I'll bet you're excited.




 Yes, but I'm also really nervous.


 Where's Kevin?
 He's in front of the house.
 What is he doing?
 Washing his car.
 Not again?
 Yes, he takes good care of his car.
 But he never cleans his room.
 I know. It's always dirty.
 And nothing is in order.
 You're right. His room is a mess.
 Maybe he should move into his car!


 This is a big menu.
 Yeah, what are you getting?
 Chicken, peas, and baked potatoes.
 I don't know what to get.
 They have very good turkey.
 I had turkey yesterday.
 How about steak?
 Perfect. I'll get steak and mashed potatoes.
 What vegetable are you getting?
 I'm not getting any. I don't like vegetables.


 I have some good news.
 What is it?
 Lisa is going to have a baby.
 That's great! I'm so happy for her.
 Me too!
 Do they want a boy or a girl?
 A girl.
 When's the baby due?
 In the beginning of September.
 I'm going to phone Lisa tonight.
 That's nice. Say hello for me.






 Jean!
 Barbara! Do you work around here?
 Yes, I work in that building across the street.
 Really? What do you do?
 I work in a law office, I'm a secretary.
 Oh, that's interesting.
 What about you? What do you do?
 I work at Duru Restaurant.
 Oh...are you a cook?
 No, I'm a waitress.
 That's a really hard job; I don't envy you.
 Me neither!
(In the bus)
 Do you live alone, Jean?
 No, I don't. I live with my family. How about you?
 I'm married now. I got married last year.
 Really? Congratulations!
 Whom did you marry?
 His name's Jeff Hunt. He lives in my building.
 Oh, what does he do?
 He's a doctor.
 How wonderful, I'm very happy for you!


 Your garden is really lovely.
 Thank you. I enjoy working in the garden.
 Do you do everything yourself?
 I trim the bushes and weed the flowerbeds myself.
 Who cuts the grass?
 Oh, it's so big that I hire one of the boys in the neighbourhood to do it for me.
 Well, I must say he does a good job.
 Yes. His work is more than satisfactory.


 I'm very angry with my son, Harry.
 Why? What's the problem?
 He's not doing well in school.
 That's a surprise. Harry is a smart boy.
 Yes, but he never studies.
 Did you talk to his teachers?
 Yes, I did.
 What did they say?
 He's a nice boy, but he's very lazy.




 Maybe they're right.
 I'm afraid so.
 Have you thought about getting him a tutor?
 Maybe that's a good idea; I really want him to excel.
 Let's go look in the phone book now then.


 What time is it?
 It's three o'clock.
 Oh no, I'm late.
 Where are you going?
 To the dentist.
 Can I drive you there?
 Sure! That will help.
 Do you have a toothache?
 Yes, and it's very bad.
 I'm sorry to hear that.
 I've had it for weeks, and this is the first time that I could get in. My dentist is
always so busy!
 I guess that's a good thing! It means a lot of people like him.


 Who is it?
 It's me, dear.
 Don't you have your key?
 No, let me in! (Lets her in)
 What's in that box? What did you get?
 A new dress, honey.
 But you have a closet full of dresses.
 I know, but I need a new one.
 What's wrong with all the other dresses?
 They're not this one!


 Let's go for a picnic.
 That's a great idea! Where shall we go?
 Let's go to the park.
 How far is it?
 About a mile.
 Is it a nice place?
 Sure. It has picnic tables and a beautiful lake.
 Good. I'll make some sandwiches.




 I'll bring soda and cookies.
 The kids will love it.


 We've got ten inches of snow.
 Wow! That's terrific!
 What's so terrific about it?
 I'm going skiing.
 Skiing? Are you serious?
 Yes. It's a lot of fun.
 Maybe, but it's also dangerous.
 You need to live on the edge!
 And you need to make sure you don't fall off it!


 Sara! You can't park here! It's a bus stop.
 Oh, we'll be back in a few minutes. It's OK.
 Oh, no, it isn't. You'll get a parking ticket if you leave it here.
 No, I won't. It's half past five. All the traffic wardens have gone home.
 Sara!
 Yes?
 Is this your car, ma'am?


 Whew! I'm really tired and now I have to go home and cook.
 Do you make dinner every night?
 Yes, I usually make dinner, and my husband washes the dishes.
 I live alone, so I do everything. Sometimes I eat out, though. There are some good
restaurants in my neighbourhood.
 Where do you live?
 Near the Pen Centre.
 That's good. There aren't any good restaurants near my house.
 Does your husband help you do housework much?
 Umm...yes. He sets the table almost every night, and he makes our bed every
morning. But I usually make all the meals.
 How about cleaning?
 We clean the house together every weekend. I vacuum the rooms, and he usually
sweeps the floor of the kitchen, and he does yard work.
 Your husband helps you so much. Does he help do the laundry too?
 Well, he's never helped me do the laundry.






 Hey, Cindy! Have you finished the exam?
 Yes, I have. Whew!
 Was it hard?
 Well, yes. It was hard--pretty hard.
 Did you pass?
 I don't know.  Lester didn't tell me.
 What questions did she ask?
 First she asked me what my name was.
 That was easy, wasn't it?
 Yes, except I couldn't remember! Then she asked me where I came from, and how
long it took to get here from my country.
 And what else did she ask?
 She asked how long I'd been studying English here in Canada, and she asked how
I would use English in the future.
 Yes, yes, go on.
 Then she asked me to explain the difference between my country and Canada.
 Anything else?
 I'm trying to remember. Oh, yes! She asked if I spoke any other language.
 Is that all?
 Oh, there were a lot of other questions. She asked me what my hobbies were,
where I visited in Canada. Then I was asked to read a passage.
 What did she say at the end?
 Hmm. Let's see... Oh, Yes! She asked me to tell you to go in--right away.


 Well, see you tomorrow.
 I'd better go, too. Oh, would you do me a favour?
 Sure.
 Would you call me tomorrow at six o'clock in the morning? Tomorrow is my
daughter's birthday. I want to get her a new robe, and I have to pick up the dry cleaning,
and pick up the cake from the bakery. Anyway, I have lots of things to do. But I'm not
sure I can get up early.
 Do you need a hand?
 Oh, can you? That would be great; can you go to the mall and buy her a new robe,
pick up the dry cleaning, and get the cake from the bakery?
 And what will you be doing?
 Sleeping in of course!


 Are you going out with Leonard tonight?
 Uh-huh. He's supposed to pick me up at six thirty. What time is it now?
 Quarter to six. You'd better get going.




 You're kidding. I haven't even taken a shower.
 Where are you going?
 We haven't made up our minds yet. Maybe to a movie, maybe to a party.
 Go and see Forrest Gump. It's supposed to be interesting.
 Oh, maybe we will. I've heard The Sixth Sense is good, too.
 Well, personally I prefer Forrest Gump. I really should be going. Do you want to
go shopping tomorrow?
 I'd like to go, but it depends. I might have to go to the store tomorrow and do
some work. Can I let you know first thing in the morning?
 OK, that would be all right. (Rrring, rrring)
 Oh, there's the phone. It must be Leonard.
 Well, I'll be going. Call me up tomorrow.
 I will. Have a good evening.
 You too.


  Good afternoon, Scott and Smith. May I help you?
 May I speak to  Scott or  Smith, please?
  I'm sorry, they aren't here right now. Who's calling, please?
 George Martin.
  Is there any message I can take,  Martin?
 No, I'll call back later.
  Thank you for calling Scott and Smith.


 Can I get you something to drink?
 A cup of coffee, please.
 With milk and sugar?
 A little milk, but no sugar.
 I never drink coffee at night.
 Why not?
 It keeps me awake.
 What do you drink with supper?
 Tea, it helps me relax.
 I don't like tea.
 There are so many kinds of tea; maybe you should shop around and try to find one
you like because coffee is so bad for you.
 That's a good idea.


 How about a drink, tonight?
 I'd love to.




 Where can we meet?
 How about the Relax Bar?
 All right. What time?
 Is eight o'clock OK?
 Yes that's fine.
 I will meet you there; I'm really looking forward to it!
 Me too!


 You sound terrible.
 I have a sore throat.
 You should rest your voice.
 I know. It hurts when I talk.
 What are you taking for your throat?
 Hot tea and honey.
 That should help. Are you going to work today?
 No, I'm staying home.
 Good idea.
 I'll feel better tomorrow.
 I hope so.


 Do you like my new coat?
 It looks terrific!
 I'm glad you like it.
 How much was it?
 Eighty dollars.
 That's a good price.
 Yeah, it was on sale.
 Where did you get it?
 At Sears.
 I like to shop there, too; they always have really good sales!
 Maybe you should go there today, you the have a sale on shirts if you're interested.
 Good idea! I need some.


 What a beautiful day!
 Yes, there's not a cloud in the sky.
 What's the temperature?
 It's seventy degrees.
 I love October.
 Me too. It's not too hot and not too cold.




 Fall is my favourite season.
 Mine, too.
 The weather is almost perfect.
 And the leaves are very pretty when they change colours.


 Is it cold out?
 Yes, it's cold and windy!
 I'm going to wear my heavy coat.
 Good idea! Where are you going?
 To the post office.
 Why?
 To mail this package.
 Would you buy some stamps for me?
 Sure. How many do you want?
 Ten. Here's the money for the stamps.
 Okay. I'll be back in twenty minutes, unless I get blown away!


 Do you like snow?
 No! I hate it!
 Why? Snow is so pretty.
 Yes, but I don't like to drive in it.
 Well, it's beginning to snow.
 And I have to drive to work.
 How far is it to work?
 Six miles. Are we going to get much snow?
 About twelve inches, they say.
 Oh no! Driving will be dangerous! Please be careful!
 I will, by the way, can I borrow your car?


 When is your vacation?
 It starts next week.
 Where are you going?
 We're renting a house on the shore.
 That's wonderful!
 Yes, we love the ocean.
 Do you swim a lot?
 Not very much.
 Then, why are you going to the shore?
 Because we all bought new swim suits!






 I'm going to play soccer.
 Who are you playing with?
 Some friends from work.
 Are you a good soccer player?
 Yes, but I'm not the best player on the team.
 What time does the game begin?
 Nine o'clock. Why don't you come with me?
 I can't today. I'm very busy.
 Okay. See you later.
 I hope your team wins.


 My son is graduating from high school today!
 And my daughter is graduating next year.
 How old is she?
 She's sixteen.
 I remember when she was a baby.
 I know. We're getting old.
 Don't say that!
 Why not? It's true.
 No, it isn't. We were young when we got married.
 That's right, but we got married 25 years ago!


 Today is my cousin's birthday.
 What's your cousin's name?
 Kathy. I'm going to her house after dinner.
 How old is she?
 She's twenty-four.
 Hmm. She's my age. Is she pretty?
 Yes, and she's very nice, too.
 Is she single?
 No, she's married and has two children.
 Oh that's too bad.
 Not for her! He he he...


 What are you getting Jim for his birthday?




 I don't know yet.
 You can always get him a shirt.
 But I got him one last year.
 Oh, that's right. Let me think.
 I want to get him something different.
 How about a briefcase?
 Good idea! His briefcase is getting old.
 And it's something he'll use every day.
 Of course! Why didn't I think of that?


  Hello?
 Hello, is Mary there?
  I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
 Oh...is this 685-5290?
  No, it's not.
 I'm sorry.
  That's OK.


 Would you like anything else? You haven't eaten very much.
 No, thanks. I'm already full.
 Oh, come on. Have some more.
 No, I really can't. I've never been much of an eater.
 Have some coffee then.
 That would be nice.
 How do you take it?
 With sugar please, no cream.
 Here you are.
 Thank you.


 This is a nice flat.
 Mmm...
 There's a living room. There's a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom, and there's
a bidet!
 What is a bidet?
 It's like a toilet, only better, I'll let you figure it out!
 Well, none of my friends have a bidet, and even if I don't know what it is, they will
be jealous when I tell them!






 Well, here's the kitchen.
 Hmm...It's very small.
 Yes, it isn't very large, but there's a cooker and a fridge. There are some
cupboards under the sink.
 Are there any plates?
 Yes, there are.
 Good. Are there any chairs in here?
 No, there aren't, but there are some in the living room.
 Hmm. There aren't any glasses!
 Yes, there are! They're in the cupboard.
 ...and ...er... where's the toilet?


 Where is your meeting?
 In Dallas, Texas.
 How are you going?
 By plane.
 Do you like to fly?
 Sure. It's fast and comfortable.
 I'm afraid of flying.
 That's silly. Flying is very safe.
 Maybe, but I don't feel safe in a plane.
 I understand. A lot of people feel that way.


 I'd like to reconfirm my plane reservation.
  What flight are you taking?
 Flight 207.
  And your name, please?
 Henry Chandler.
  Yes, sir. You're booked on Flight 207. Please check in at the airport an hour
before flight time.
 Thank you.


 Are you free Friday night?
 I might not be in town. I'm not sure yet. A friend suggested I go to Vancouver.
 Well, a few of us are getting together, and I thought you might want to come, too.
 What are you thinking of doing?
 We're not sure yet. We might go to a bar, but we'll probably go see A. I.




 Oh, I haven't seen yet.
 Well, come then.
 Sure, if I'm in town. I'll call you and let you know.


  Oh,  Wallace! Long time no see.
  How are you?
  Good. Thank you. How's your new job?
  I started working today.
  How does it seem so far?
  It's demanding, but I'm happy to be working.
  What's your boss like?
  He appears to be very thoughtful and kind, but they all do at first. I guess
we will have to see.
  Well, I wish you the best of luck.
  Thanks, take care.


 Did you see my car keys?
 They're on top of the TV.
 You're right. Thanks!
 Where are you going?
 To the supermarket.
 Again?
 Yes, we eat a lot.
 Do you want me to go with you?
 Sure, if you can.
 Good. The packages will be heavy.
 There is a new health store right up the road; maybe since you guys eat a lot you
should try and eat more healthily.
 Maybe you're right; we have all put on a little weight.


 Diana!
 Oh, George...hi, how are you? Listen, I'm in a terrible hurry. The bank closes in
twenty minutes.
 Is your bank near here?
 Yes, it's only four blocks away--on Vine Street.
 Well, get in. I'll take you.
 Are you sure? It's not out of your way?
 No, not at all.
 This is so nice of you, George. Thank you.




 You're welcome.


 Hi! Sorry I'm late. I missed the bus.
 Oh, that's O. K. I had time to clean up before you come.
 You don't look very good.
 I must be getting a cold. I've been sneezing all day. A-A-AT!
 Bless you.
 Thank you.
 You must be getting a cold. Why don't you go lie down? I'll bring you some aspirin.
...
 I don't see any aspirin in the medicine cabinet.
 We must be out of them.
 I'll go to the drugstore. Is there anything else we need?
 Could you get some...AT...
 I don't know if they sell AT there, but I'll check!


 When can I see Dr. Know?
 He won't be free until tomorrow.
 Can I make an appointment?
 Sure. How about tomorrow at ten o'clock?
 Can you make it at nine?
 I check to see if he's available. I'm sorry but he's tied up until ten o'clock.
 Well, can't you squeeze me in, somehow?
 I'm afraid not. How about after lunch?
 Will one o'clock be all right?
 That's perfect. Thank you.


 Excuse me. May I see your licence?
 I'm afraid I've left it at home.
 In that case, you'll have to take it to the police station within five days.
 But...but why?
 You were speeding, ma'am.
 But I was only doing 75!
 There's a 70km/h speed limit on this road, ma'am.
 Is there? I didn't see the sign...
 Well, ma'am. We've been following you.
 So you were doing 75, too.
 No, ma'am. We were doing 90km/h... and we couldn't catch you!






 Waiter! Could we have the bill, please?
 Can I put it all on one bill?
 No, we'd prefer separate checks.
 Your bill's eighteen dollars.
 That seems expensive. Would you check it again please?
 Sorry, ma'am. This is your friend's bill. Here is yours; it's twenty-four dollars and
sixteen cents!


 Excuse me...
 Yes. Can I help you?
 Yes, I'd like some information about buses please.
 Where to?
 ... to Toronto.
 When?
 This Saturday.
 Morning or afternoon?
 In the afternoon. About three o'clock.
 There's one at 20.
 Thank you that sounds perfect; I'll take it!


  Good morning, Scott and Smith Law Office. May I help you?
 Yes. May I speak to David Waller, please?
  I'm sorry, he isn't here yet. May I take a message?
 Yes. Could you ask him to call Marjorie Vale?
  How do you spell your last name?
 V-A-L-E.
  What's your phone number? Or does  Waller have it?
 Uh, no, he doesn't. It's 680-5290.
  I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
 680-5290.
  I'll give him the message.
 Thank you.
  You're welcome.


  Martin? I'm Dr. Thomas.
  Oh, doctor, how is he?




 Well, I'm afraid we'll have to operate.
  Oh, no! He's always been afraid of operations.
 Don't worry. If we operate now, he'll be all right.
  Oh, doctor, do you really have to?
 I'm afraid so. He's lost a lot of blood. If we don't operate, he'll die!
  Oh, please just do whatever you have to.


 I want to go to the bank this afternoon.
 I'll drive you there.
 Thanks. I'm going to apply for a loan.
 Why do you need a loan?
 I have to buy a new car.
 What's wrong with your car?
 It won't start, and it's ten years old.
 How much will a new car cost?
 About fifteen thousand dollars.
 Wow! That's a lot of money.
 I know. That's why I need a loan.


 What kind of work do you do?
 I'm a cashier at a supermarket.
 Do you like your job?
 No, It's not very interesting.
 And you don't make much money.
 That's right. I make very little.
 I think you should look for another job.
 I am, but it's not easy to find one.
 Keep looking! You'll get one.
 Thanks. I hope you're right.


  How are you settling in?
 Oh, we're still in a bit of a mess, but Lisa seems to like it here.
  That's good. Is there a garden for her to play in?
 Yes, it's not very big, but we've got a small swimming pool.
  Have you found a school for Jerry?
 Yes, there's one near here. It takes only 5 minutes by car.
  That's good. So you like it there, do you, Neal?
 Yes, this is a very good place for my children.






 Is there a bakery near here?
 Yes, you can get there in five minutes.
 That's good. I don't have much time.
 Why are you going to the bakery?
 To buy birthday cake.
 Whose birthday is it?
 My daughter's. She's ten.
 That's nice. Will you get some bread for me?
 Sure, do you want anything else?
 No, thanks. I'll pay you when you get back.


 I'm trying to find a wedding anniversary present for my wife.
 Yes, sir. What exactly are you looking for?
 I'm not sure, really. Perhaps you can help me.
 Right...I'll show you some pendants.
 No, I bought a pendant for her birthday.
 Maybe a necklace, then. These necklaces are made of gold.
 Yes...I like this one. What's the stone?
 It's a ruby, sir...and it's only $1200!
 Ah...well, perhaps you could show me some bracelets, then.


  Good morning. Perhaps you can advise me...
 Yes, ma'am.
  I'm looking for a toy...for my niece.
 Oh, yes...how old is she?
  She'll be seven years old on Sunday.
 Skateboards are still very popular.
  Hmm, I don't want her to hurt herself.
 What about a Barbie Doll set?
  I don't think so. She has many Barbie Dolls. Have you got anything
educational? You see she's a very intelligent girl.
 I've got the perfect thing! A do-it-yourself kit where you can build your own
Barbie Doll who rides a skateboard!


 Can I get some tickets for plays?
 Yes. Is there a specific play that you want to see?




 What plays are on tonight?
 Cats. But it's sold out.
 Are there any seats left for tomorrow night?
 Yes. How many tickets do you want?
 Two, please.
 Where would you like to sit?
 I'm not sure.
 Well, here's a seating plan of the concert hall.
 How much is it in the middle section?
 $50.
 $50! That's a little too expensive for us. How much is it in the back?
 $35.
 That's fine. What time does the play start?
 At 00.
 What time will the play be over?
 At 30.


 Are you ready?
 Grace is still in her room.
 She needs to rush. We don't have enough time.
 What time does the movie begin?
 It starts at seven thirty.
 What's the time now?
 About seven ten.
 There's no hurry. It only takes ten minutes by car to get there.
 I know, but there aren't enough parking spaces around the theatre.
 Well, I'd better tell Grace to hurry up. She can take hours to get ready.


 I thought that movie was terrific, didn't you?
 I don't know. It didn't seem to have any meaning.
 Come on. It seems that you expect intellectual stimulation from every movie.
 I just think that a good movie should have a central theme at least.
 Yes. But it doesn't hurt you to watch a funny movie once in a while. Relax and
enjoy it!
 You're right. I'm too serious sometimes.


 I see you're reading Harry Potter. How do you like it?
 I can't put it down. Have you read it?
 Yes. In fact, I just finished it. The ending's great...




 Don't tell me! I only have fifty pages to go.
 OK, I won't tell you who dies.
 DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING!
 OK, but I'm biting my tongue.
 Good, bite hard!
 Such a shame though.
 What is?
 That Harry dies.
 AHHHHH!!!


   Adams, have you seen this ad in the Recruit News?
  Yes, I saw it, but I'm not interested in finding a new job. I've been here since I
graduated from my university. I like working here.
  Really? I've only been here for one year, and I'm already tired of doing the
same thing every day. I'm afraid of getting really bored.
  Oh, come on! It's not that bad. Wherever you work, you have to do the same
thing every day to a certain degree.
  Well, what's more, I've been working about ten hours a day since last
month.
  But you've been getting paid more money for it, haven't you?
  Yes, but I'm not interested in making more money. I'm going to apply for
another job.
  What kind of job?
  A secretarial job.
  Well, good luck.
  Thank you very much!


 Hello?
 Sandy? Is that you?
 Yes, uh-huh. Who's this?
 It's Gill.
 Gill? Gill who?
 What you do you mean, &quot;Gill who?&quot; Gill Dixon, of course.
 Oh, Gill, I'm sorry.
 Yes. We had a date last night. Where were you? I waited for one hour.
 Oh, I'm sorry, Gill. I couldn't come.
 Couldn't come! Why not?
 Well, I had to pack my stuff for my trip.
 Why didn't you call me?
 I wanted to call you, but-uh-I-uh- couldn't remember your phone number.
 And now I'm going to forget yours!






 Do you smoke? I've never known that. When did you start smoking?
 I started smoking when I was eighteen.
 So, how long have you been a smoker?
 I have smoked for twenty years.
 How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?
 I smoke two packs of cigarettes a day.
 Have you ever tried to quit?
 Yes, I have quit  once when I was expecting my baby, Paul, and the other time
when I had a bad sore throat. But I had a hard time.
 If you knew what it was doing to your lungs, you would think twice about it!


 Did you hear about the Smith family?
 No, what happened?
  Smith passed away this morning.
 That's a shame. What from?
 Heart attack, I think.
 That's a terrible thing.
 Yes.  Smith went into hospital last night by ambulance and died this morning.
 Had she been suffering from heart disease?
 Yeah.  Smith had it for five years before she died.
 Did they try surgery?
 She had two operations, but they weren't effective.
 I feel sorry for  Smith.


 Have you heard about the good news in the Wallace family?
 No, I've been out of town.
  Wallace went into the hospital last night and gave birth to a baby girl seven
hours later.
 That's very good. But they already have a little girl, don't they?
 No, they have a five-year-old boy.
 So they wanted a girl this time, right?
 Yes, they wanted a girl for a long time.
 Was it natural childbirth?
 No, she had to have a caesarean.


 Teresa! What a surprise! What are you doing here?




 Timothy! I don't believe it! I'm going to see my daughter. She will marry this
weekend. How about you?
 I'm going to visit my parents. When is your daughter's wedding?
 Sunday.
 Wow! This Sunday is the 45th wedding anniversary of their wedding, too.
 This is a surprise! Anyway, where is your train leaving from?
 My train leaves from Platform 3, over there.
 How long will you...
 Now leaving from Platform 3, train for Vancouver.
 That's my train. I have to run. Sorry we didn't have more time to talk.
 That's OK. I'll see you when you get back. Have a good time, and say
congratulations to your parents!


 Raymond!
 Oh, hi, Grace! How have you been?
 Good! I hear you have been to Toronto for a few days.
 Yes. I just got back yesterday.
 Did you have a nice visit?
 Really nice. It was very good going around downtown and shopping. And I
saw the Toronto Blue Jays game at Skydome. It seems that Toronto is a very exciting city.
My brother Stanley was there, too. You've met Stanley, haven't you?
 Sure. I met him when he was here in Hamilton last year. What's he doing these
days? Still teaching baseball?
 Yes, as matter of fact, he just began to teach elementary school.
 Great. How's everything with his kids?
 Have you met my nieces?
 Yes, they visited you once in the summer, didn't they?
 Right. They're both fine.
 I haven't seen them in a long time. They must be really big.
 Well, they will come over this Christmas. Let's have a great Christmas party
together.
 That's a good idea.
